        body: `Your teeth and gums send signals when something is wrong. Ignoring these warning signs can turn minor issues into major dental problems that require extensive — and expensive — treatment. As a dental surgeon practicing in Model Town, Rohtak, I see patients every week who wish they had come in sooner. Here are five signs that you need to visit a dentist in Rohtak immediately.\n\n## 1. Persistent Toothache\n\nA toothache that lasts more than a day or two is never normal. It could indicate tooth decay that has reached the nerve, a dental abscess, or a cracked tooth. Over-the-counter painkillers may mask the pain temporarily, but they do not address the underlying cause. If you are experiencing persistent tooth pain in Rohtak, visit Apex Dental Care for a thorough examination and diagnosis.\n\n## 2. Bleeding Gums\n\nIf your gums bleed when you brush or floss, it is an early sign of gum disease (gingivitis). Left untreated, gingivitis can progress to periodontitis, which causes bone loss and can eventually lead to tooth loss. Early intervention by a dentist in Rohtak can reverse gum disease and protect your oral health.\n\n## 3. Sensitivity to Hot and Cold\n\nSudden or increased sensitivity to hot or cold foods and drinks may indicate worn tooth enamel, exposed tooth roots, or a cavity. A dental professional at a clinic like Apex Dental Care in Rohtak, Haryana, can identify the cause and recommend appropriate treatment, whether it is a desensitizing toothpaste, a filling, or a crown.\n\n## 4. Bad Breath That Won't Go Away\n\nChronic bad breath (halitosis) that persists despite good oral hygiene can be a sign of gum disease, tooth decay, dry mouth, or an underlying infection. A dental check-up at Apex Dental Care in Model Town, Rohtak, can help pinpoint the cause and provide effective treatment.\n\n## 5. Visible Damage or Discoloration\n\nChipped, cracked, or severely discolored teeth are not just cosmetic concerns — they can compromise the structural integrity of your teeth and increase the risk of infection. Modern cosmetic and restorative dentistry at our Rohtak dental clinic can repair damage and restore your smile.\n\n## Don't Wait — Act Now\n\nDental problems rarely resolve on their own and typically worsen over time. If you are experiencing any of these symptoms, I encourage you to book an appointment at Apex Dental Care, located near Life Care Hospital in Model Town, Rohtak, Haryana. Call us at 098021 55667 — your dental health is our priority.`,

        excerpt: 'Root canal treatment does not have to be scary. Here is a complete guide to what happens during RCT at Apex Dental Care in Rohtak.',
        readTime: '6 min read',
        body: `Root canal treatment is one of the most misunderstood dental procedures. Many people associate it with extreme pain, but the truth is that modern root canal therapy is virtually painless and is designed to relieve the very pain that brought you to the dentist. At Apex Dental Care in Model Town, Rohtak, we perform hundreds of successful root canal treatments every year. Here is what you can expect.\n\n## What Is a Root Canal?\n\nA root canal treatment (RCT) is a procedure to save a tooth that is severely decayed or infected. The soft tissue (pulp) inside the tooth, which contains nerves and blood vessels, becomes inflamed or infected due to deep decay, repeated dental procedures, or trauma. During RCT, this infected pulp is removed, the inside of the tooth is cleaned and disinfected, and then filled and sealed.\n\n## When Is Root Canal Treatment Needed?\n\nYou may need root canal treatment if you experience severe tooth pain when chewing, prolonged sensitivity to hot or cold, darkening of the tooth, swelling or tenderness in the gums near the affected tooth, or a persistent pimple on the gums (dental fistula). If you notice any of these symptoms, visit our dental clinic in Rohtak for an evaluation.\n\n## The Root Canal Procedure at Apex Dental Care Rohtak\n\n### Step 1: Diagnosis\nDr. Aashish Malik will take a digital X-ray to assess the extent of infection and determine the number of root canals in the affected tooth.\n\n### Step 2: Anesthesia\nLocal anesthesia is administered to numb the area completely. This is the step that eliminates pain — you will not feel the procedure itself.\n\n### Step 3: Pulp Removal\nA small opening is made in the crown of the tooth. Using specialized instruments, the infected pulp is carefully removed from the root canals.\n\n### Step 4: Cleaning & Shaping\nThe root canals are cleaned, shaped, and irrigated with antibacterial solutions to eliminate all bacteria.\n\n### Step 5: Filling\nThe cleaned canals are filled with a biocompatible material called gutta-percha and sealed.\n\n### Step 6: Crown Placement\nIn most cases, a dental crown is placed over the treated tooth to restore its strength and appearance. At Apex Dental Care, we use high-quality ceramic crowns that match your natural tooth color.\n\n## Recovery and Aftercare\n\nMost patients can resume normal activities the same day. Mild discomfort may be present for 2-3 days and can be managed with over-the-counter pain medication. Avoid chewing on the treated tooth until the permanent crown is placed.\n\n## Why Choose Apex Dental Care for Root Canal in Rohtak?\n\nDr. Aashish Malik brings years of experience in endodontic procedures. Our clinic in Model Town, Rohtak, Haryana, is equipped with modern rotary endodontic systems and digital imaging for precise, efficient treatment. We prioritize patient comfort and use the latest techniques to make root canal therapy as smooth as possible.\n\nBook your appointment at Apex Dental Care by calling 098021 55667. Do not let fear prevent you from saving your teeth.`,
